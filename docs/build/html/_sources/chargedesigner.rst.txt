file folders used by chargedesigner.ChargeDesigner
**************************************************
If python scripts are in the main project directory, subdirectories are:

		* `input/`  - Suggested folder for json inputfile
		* `pdb/` - Preferably, store input and output pdb files here, for example in subfolders `pdb/in` and `pdb/out`
		* `constraints/` - Preferred location for rosetta charge-constraint and composition constraint files `charge_file` and `comp_file`
		* `apbs/` - Anything related to pqr2pdb and apbs goes here. Apbs input parameters are in the template file `apbs/apbs_template.in`, which must already be present. The .pqr outputfiles of pqr2pdb, the .in inputfiles for apbs, the .log files of apbs the .dx outputfiles of apbs are all written to the apbs folder, and deleted when no longer needed. For calculating protein charges used by apbs, we call pdb2pqr with these flags: 

		.. code-block:: console

			$ pdb2pqr30 --ff=AMBER --titration-state-method=propka --with-ph=7

		* `docs/` - Sphinx documentation.
		* `res/` - Temporary rosetta resfiles generated by the script for doing the mutations and repacking are saved here. 
		* `scores/` - Preferred folder for output run scores. 
		* `sym/` - Preferred folder for rosetta symmetry files
		* `theory/` - Some theory notes
