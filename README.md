# chargedesign
design protein surfaces that minimize fluctuations of surface electrostatic potential (for Cn symmetric multimers)

## dependencies:

* pyrosetta
* numpy, scipy
* gridData
* apbs, pdq2pdb

## getting started:
Make new conda environment (eg (chargedesign)) for the project, 
install the depencies in the project environment. 
Copy the whole repository to a local project directory (eg chargedesign). 
The main scripts is chargedesign.py. Run from from the chargedesign project directory within the (chargedesign) conda
environment.
